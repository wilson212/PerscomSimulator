 - Track specialty transitions for statistics
 - Add UnitTemplate statistics
 - Add better support for Billet Rank Ranges! (maybe a collective lateral selection?)
 - Establish Rank Grades seperate from Ranks in the RankEditorForm

----- Procedure's

-> Ordered (Priority) Procedure:	Goes through each pool in order, and rolls until a candidate is found
-> Randomized Procedure:	Selects from one random pool only, and checks for a candidate
-> Collective Procedure		Selects from all pools and combines all soldiers, then chooses one
