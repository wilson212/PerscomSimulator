 - Track specialty transitions for statistics
 - Add UnitTemplate statistics
 - Add better support for Billet Rank Ranges! (maybe a collective lateral selection?)
 --> Should we Auto promote a soldier if they are promotable?
 - Establish Rank Grades seperate from Ranks in the RankEditorForm

----- Procedure's

-> Ordered (Priority) Procedure:	Goes through each pool in order, and rolls until a candidate is found
-> Randomized Procedure:	Selects from one random pool only, and checks for a candidate
-> Collective Procedure		Selects from all pools and combines all soldiers, then chooses one

----- Improvable Primary Stats (Hard Coded)
---> Leadership		: Thier ability to lead soldiers
---> Marksmanship	: Ability to shoot accurately
---> Reliability	: How reliable are they? Important for staff positions. Lower rating means more movement more often (fickle)
---> Adaptability	: Ability to change to staff to command and vise versa. Also includes field situations
---> Fitness		: Fitness level
---> Proficiency	: How good are they at thier MOS or staffing ability

----- Randomly Set Secondary Stats
---> Ambition		: Thier desire to achieve the greatest ranks
---> Charisma		: How well they are liked and approved of by thier peers
---> Improvability	: How much thier stats improve over thier career

---> Consistancy
