 - Track specialty transitions for statistics
 - Add an option to Bar a soldier for promotion while locked into a billet
 --> As of right now, promotion takes precedence over minimum time (locked in billet):
 -----> Have a lock in billet, which prevents lateral movement only
 -----> Have a lock in billet, which prevents promotions
 - Add a "does not allow lateral grade promotion" to ranks (think Marine Corps 1stSgt and Msgt)
